      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>During my sophmore year in High School, I took a python programming class. At that time, writing simple lines of code and seeing them on the display, made me intrigued by it. From that point on, I been researching which side of the Tech industry I wanted to work for. I joined few organizations to learn more about web development such as Girls Who Code and Code First Girls.</p>

      <p>I like to read, watch dramas and movies, and traveling. Recently I been wanting to try out the Oculus, it seems fun.</p>
